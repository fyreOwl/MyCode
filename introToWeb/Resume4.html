                    <p>
                        Kinesiology is the science of muscle testing. It is a gentle non-evasive way to listen to your body's needs to be healthy and unlock it's ability to heal itself on an emotional, physical and chemical level.
                        This we call the health triad. Often, other disciplines only focuses on one side of this triad. Kinesiology facilitates you to keep all 3 components equal, or in other words, BALANCED.
                        It is a (w)hol(e)istic discipline that encapsulates various form of other types of healing practices for example Acupuncture, Nutrition and Physiotherapy.
                        Kinesiology does not diagnose or treat named diseases.
